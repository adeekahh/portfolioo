            Intermedia Solutions is a video production company based in
            Copenhagen operated by university students.

            The company's main activity is recording speeches at events and
            conferences but they have also worked with commercials, branding and
            animation before.

            Their current goal is to reach a wider customer base and through
            that to get clients from outside Denmark. To achieve that they
            needed to have a website that they can confidently advertise their
            services through and that can convert leads.

          </h4>

          <p class="single-work-content-main-text-p">
            The process of making the website started with a workshop where I
            gained insights from their current and aspired customers and got and
            understanding of the reasons behind their achievements and struggles
            as a company. Based on the insights we constructed 3 user personas
            that later helped us in determining the potential user flows and
            goals on the website.

            halfway through the process that they made the wrong decision and
